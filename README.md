# Human Animal Classifier
For my Universtiy of Washington CSE 455 Computer Vision class, I made and trained a model to classify between a human, dog, cat, and none. The reason I want to do this is because it could be used with home security systems, such as ones that turn on outside lights when they see movement. I thought that a classifier like this could be used to change how/when these lights turn on, such as making a setting that after a certain time, if a human is seen, then an alarm could go off to prevent a robber from ever getting to the house.
